# Programming Exercise: Full Stack Application

## Overview
This exercise involves creating a full-stack application that integrates two major service platforms: ServiceNow and Zendesk. The goal is to build a searchable user interface (UI) that leverages APIs from both platforms to display and manage ticketing information.

## Objectives
- **Integration**: Use examples in data folder to "Integrate" Zendesk and ServiceNow with our API.
- **UI Creation**: Develop the UI mocked in the mockups folder that allows users to search and navigate ticket data pulled from both platforms.
- **Database Design**: If applicable, design a basic system of record in a database to store ticket and user information.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Searchable UI**: Users should be able to search for tickets based on various criteria (e.g., ticket number, category, state).
2. **Navigation**: Users should be able to navigate through individual ticket details and related information.
3. **User Assignment**: If time permits, implement functionality for assigning tickets to users within the UI.

### Topics for discussion
4. **Authentication**: Discuss a plan to authentication flow, including any necessary security considerations.
5. **CI/CD**: Discuss the setup and configuration of a CI/CD pipeline appropriate for deploying and maintaining the application.
